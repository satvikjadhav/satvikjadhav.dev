### SQL Query Order of Execution

Each SQL query begins with finding the data that we need in a database, this data is then filtered down into something that can be processed and understood as quickly as possible.

Because each part of the query is executed sequentially, it's important to understand the order of execution so that we know what results are accessible where.

Let's consider the below mentioned query :

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column, AGG_FUNC(column_or_expression), â€¦
FROM mytable
JOIN another_table
ON mytable.column = another_table.column
WHERE constraint_expression
GROUP BY column
HAVING constraint_expression
ORDER BY column ASC/DESC
LIMIT count OFFSET COUNT;
 ```   

### Query order of execution

**1. FROM and JOINs**

The FROM clause and subsequent JOINs are first executed in order to determine the total working set of data that is being queried. This also includes subqueries in this clause, and can cause temporary tables to be created under the hood containing all the columns and rows of the tables being joined.

**2\. WHERE**

Once we have the total working set of data, the WHERE clause is applied to the individual rows, and rows that do not satisfy this constraint are discarded. Each of these constraints can only access columns directly from the tables requested in the FROM clause. Aliases in the SELECT part of the query are not accessible in most databases since they may include expressions dependent on parts of the query that have not yet executed.

**3\. GROUP BY**

The remaining rows after the WHERE constraints are then grouped by based on common values in the column specified in the GROUP BY clause. As a result of the grouping, there will only be as many rows as there are unique values in that column. Implicitly, this means that you should only need to use this when you have aggregate functions in your query.

**4. HAVING**

If the query has a GROUP BY clause, then the constraints in the HAVING clause are then applied to the grouped rows, discard the grouped rows that don't satisfy the constraint. Like the WHERE clause, aliases are also not accessible from this step in most databases.

**5. SELECT**

Any expressions in the SELECT part of the query are finally computed.

**6. DISTINCT**

Of the remaining rows, rows with duplicate values in the column marked as DISTINCT will be discarded.

**7. ORDER BY**

If an order is specified by the ORDER BY clause, the rows are then sorted by the specified data in either ascending or descending order. Since all the expressions in the SELECT part of the query have been computed, you can reference aliases in this clause.

**8. LIMIT OFFSET**

Finally, the rows that fall outside the range specified by the LIMIT and OFFSET are discarded, leaving the final set of rows to be returned from the query.
