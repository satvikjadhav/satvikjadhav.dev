I’m a **Data Engineer** at **Ocean Technologies Group**, currently focused on building and enhancing our **Data Platform** using a variety of technologies including **AWS EMR**, **ECS**, **Spark**, **Druid**, **Superset**, **Airflow**, **Postgres**, and more.

I have a passion for **puzzles** and **creating** things, and coding allows me to engage both interests simultaneously. I’m also fascinated by the world of **Finance** and the **stock market**, which inspires me to develop **algorithmic trading programs** in my spare time. In addition to tech, I enjoy diving into **sci-fi** books, TV series, and movies.

If you're still reading this, it seems you might be interested in knowing more about me!

I’m a self-taught programmer, having started with **Java** but now primarily use **Python**. I believe in being adaptable, which drives me to learn new programming languages and leverage the best tools for each project.

I’m particularly intrigued by the field of **Computer Science** – specifically **Parallel** and **Distributed Systems**, and strive to expand my knowledge in this area every day.

### Currently Learning:
- **Java**
- **Spark**
- **Kafka**
- **Druid**
- **Docker**
