Data Engineer at Ocean Technologies Group. I enjoy puzzles and creating/developing things. Coding lets me do both at the same time. Facinated by the world of Finance and the stock market, and work on Algotrading programs in my spare time. Science fiction lover - I enjoy everything from sci-fi books to TV series to Movies.

If youâ€™re still reading this then, boy, you must be interested in knowing more about me.

I learnt programming on my own. Java was the language I started with but Python is my most used language. However, I try to make an effort to learn other programming languages as well becuase I believe in being flexible, and it also allows me to use the best tool for the job at hand.

I am fascinated by the field of Big Data, and I am making an effort to learn more about it everyday!

Currently Learning:
* PySpark
* Kafka
* Airflow
* Docker
* Terraform
* Streamlit
