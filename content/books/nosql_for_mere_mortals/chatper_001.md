NoSQL databases, as the name suggests, either do not use SQL or are designed to go beyond it, offering flexibility for various data types and structures. While relational databases were a breakthrough for data management—minimizing inconsistencies and anomalies—they also have their limitations. 

NoSQL databases revisit some features of early data systems while aiming to overcome the constraints of relational models, such as rigid schemas and scalability issues. When evaluating NoSQL options, it’s essential to understand how they address the shortcomings of relational databases while recognizing any shared limitations with earlier systems. This context will help you choose the right solution for your data management needs.
