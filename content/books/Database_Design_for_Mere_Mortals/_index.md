## Introduction
**Avoiding Sample Structures**  
Using sample structures can lead to improper, inefficient, and incomplete designs. Database issues typically fall into two categories: application utilization problems and data problems. 

**Application Problems** arise from inexperienced developers who lack knowledge of effective design methodologies, the software being used, or the data involved. Common issues include poor data entry forms, confusing interfaces, and cumbersome processes.

**Data Problems** include missing, incorrect, or mismatched information, often stemming from poor database design. A properly structured database is essential for meeting an organizationâ€™s information needs.

## Purpose of the Book
The database development process consists of three phases:

1. **Logical Design**: Define tables, fields, keys, relationships, and data integrity levels.
2. **Physical Implementation**: Create tables and establish relationships while using appropriate tools for data integrity.
3. **Application Development**: Develop an application for user interaction with the database, which involves identifying user tasks, report requirements, and navigation menus.

Starting with logical design ensures informed, methodical decisions about your database structure, minimizing the need for later modifications during implementation and application development. 

Think of design techniques as tools, each serving a specific purpose. Mastering these tools generically allows you to apply them effectively in various situations.
